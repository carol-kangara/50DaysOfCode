# 50DaysOfCode

On 1st January, 2019, I started the challenge of 50 Days Of Code challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for the next 50 days in Python, Java and C++. The problems will be selected from HackerRank and LeetCode. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. I expect this challenge to enhance my skills and keep in touch with few of the most practiced languages.

## Day 4

In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 747

## Day 5

Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1. You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 462

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/

## Day 6

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 80

## Day 7

Given a string S that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let N = S.length. Return any permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N] such that for all i = 0, ..., N-1, such that, if S[i] == "I", then A[i] < A[i+1] and if S[i] == "D", then A[i] > A[i+1].

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 942

## Day 8

In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example. What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 807

## Day 9

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 771

## Day 11

Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 537

## Day 12

In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times. Return the element repeated N times.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 961

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence. Given N, calculate F(N).

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 509

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

## Day 14

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 2

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Day 15

S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
