# 50DaysOfCode

On 1st January, 2019, I started the challenge of 50 Days Of Code challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for the next 50 days in Python, Java and C++. The problems will be selected from HackerRank and LeetCode. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. I expect this challenge to enhance my skills and keep in touch with few of the most practiced languages.

## Day 4

In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 747

## Day 5

Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1. You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 462

## Day 6

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Number:** 80

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/

## Day 7

Given a string S that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let N = S.length. Return any permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N] such that for all i = 0, ..., N-1, such that, if S[i] == "I", then A[i] < A[i+1] and if S[i] == "D", then A[i] > A[i+1].

**From:** LeetCode

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Number:** 942
