# 50DaysOfCode

On 1st January, 2019, I started 50 Days Of Code challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledged to code for the next 50 days in Python, Java and C++. The problems were selected from LeetCode and the code was pushed iff all the test cases are successful. I completed this challenge to enhance my skills and keep in touch with few of the most practiced languages. 

## Results 

During the last 50 days I covered 10+ topics from different difficulty levels and achieved 100 percentile time complexity 35 times. I have created few visual statistics to give viewers a better idea.
